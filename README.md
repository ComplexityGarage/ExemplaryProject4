# Description of the project 
This project aims to utilize technology of electrode-based muscle contraction detection to form a basic form of communication with partially disabled people.
# Science and tech used 
In general, detecting muscle contraction involves placing three electrodes (MID, END and REF) in specific places. As name suggests, MID electrode should be placed in the middle of muscle of interest, END electrode is placed in direction of the muscle and REF (reference) electrode placement depends on specific muscle, but most often it is placed somewhere else than the muscle.

A device that implements the description above is e.g. DFRobot Gravity analogue EMG sensor shown below:
